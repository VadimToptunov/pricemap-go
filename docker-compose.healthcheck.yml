# Docker Compose Health Check Configuration
#
# This file provides health check capabilities for Docker deployments.
# Since the main image uses 'scratch' base (no curl/wget), we need
# an alternative approach for Docker health checks.
#
# Usage:
#   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.healthcheck.yml up

version: '3.8'

services:
  server:
    healthcheck:
      # Use wget from a sidecar or external probe
      # For production, use Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes instead
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "--no-verbose", "--tries=1", "--spider", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
    # Note: This requires alpine or similar base image with wget/curl
    # Current scratch image doesn't support this - use K8s probes instead

  # Alternative: Use a health check sidecar
